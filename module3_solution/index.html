            <h2>Paneer</h2>
            <p>
                It’s a fresh, cream-coloured and normally unsalted cheese, historically made from buffalo milk, though a blend of this and cow’s milk is now the norm. It's widely used in north India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal and Bangladesh and its mildness is a perfect foil for stronger flavours, which it absorbs easily.Paneer is made without rennet, by curdling hot milk with lemon or lime juice, vinegar, yoghurt or citric acid.  Cubed paneer should be firm so that it doesn’t crumble easily, but not hard, and you should judge a paneer dish by how soft and fluffy the cheese is.Paneer, a popular indigenous dairy product of India, is similar to an unripened variety of soft cheese which is used in the preparation of a variety of culinary dishes and snacks. It is obtained by heat and acid coagulation of milk, entrapping almost all the fat, casein complexed with denatured whey proteins and a portion of salts and lactose. Paneer is marble white in appearance, having firm, cohesive and spongy body with a close-knit texture and a sweetish-acidic-nutty flavour. Preparation of paneer using different types of milk and varied techniques results in wide variation in physico-chemical, microbiological and sensory quality of the product. Paneer blocks of required size are packaged in laminated plastic pouches, preferably vacuum packaged, heat sealed and stored under refrigeration. Paneer keeps well for about a day at ambient temperature and for about a week under refrigeration (7 °C). The spoilage of paneer is mainly due to bacterial action. Successful attempts have been made to enhance the shelf life of paneer. This review deals with the history, method of manufacture, factors affecting the quality, physico-chemical changes during manufacture, chemical composition and nutritional profile, packaging and shelf life of paneer.

            <h2>Hamburger</h2>
            <p>
                Hamburgers are traditionally made with ground beef and served with onions, tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, and other garnishes. You can also make a hamburger with turkey or other kinds of meat — although rarely, if ever, is ham used in a hamburger. Hamburgers were originally called "hamburg steak," named for the German city of Hamburg, although no actual connection between the place and the food has ever been documented.Hamburgers are customarily eaten as a sandwich, between two halves of a round bun. Mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, and other condiments, along with garnishes of lettuce, onion, tomato, and sliced cucumber pickle, constitute the customary dressing. In the variation known as the cheeseburger, a slice of cheese is melted over the patty. The patty itself is often seasoned or augmented with chopped onions, spices, or bread crumbs before cooking.

            <h2>Idli</h2>
            <p>
                Idli is a round, fluffy bread roughly eight centimetres in diameter. Idli is made from ground rice or rice flour mixed with ground urad dal, salt, methi (fenugreek seeds) and water. The mixture is allowed to ferment prior to being steamed in an idli steamer. They are traditional to Southern India and are most often eaten with sambar.
                Idli also romanized idly or iddly, plural idlis, is a traditional breakfast in south Indian households. Idli is savory cake of South India and and is a [[Cuisine of Tamil Nadu that is very popular throughout India. The name 'Idli' basically comes from the Tamil words ittu and aavi. The words ittu and aavi in Tamil means cooked by 'keep'ing in 'steam'. Earliest mention of idli occurs in the Kannada writing called Vaddaradhane by Shivakotiacharya in 920 AD. The cakes are usually two to three inches in diameter and are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolized by the body. Most often eaten at breakfast or as a snack, idlis are usually served in pairs with chutney, sambar, or other accompaniments. Mixtures of crushed dry spices such as milagai podi are the preferred condiment for idlis eaten on the go. A variant of Idli known as sanna is very popular amongst the Goans and other Konkani people. Another variant known as "Enduri Pitha" is very popular in Odisha. For preparation of "Enduri Pitha", mixture of black gram paste and ground once-boiled rice is wrapped in turmeric leaf and steam cooked
